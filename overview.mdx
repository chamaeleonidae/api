## Authentication

All API requests require your Account Secret key:

```bash
curl -H "X-Account-Secret: YOUR_ACCOUNT_SECRET" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.chameleon.io/v3/analyze/profiles
```

<Info>
Find your Account Secret in your [Chameleon dashboard](https://app.chameleon.io) under Settings > Integrations.

## Base URLs

<Note>
Use `https://api.chameleon.io` or `https://api.trychameleon.com` for all requests (either will work but use `chameleon.io` for new projects.)
