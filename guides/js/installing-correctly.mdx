title: "Installing correctly"
---

In your SaaS product you likely have Users and Accounts (simply a group of Users often from the same real Company)

Chameleon is designed to mirror this in its design of [User Profiles](apis/profiles), [Companies](apis/companies),
[Segments](apis/segments), searchable [HelpBar content](guides/helpbar/user-generated-content), etc.

<Note>First, generate JavaScript Code on the [installation page](https://app.chameleon.io/setup/install) and adapt based on this guide.</Note>

## The entrypoint JavaScript {#on-page-script}

The sets up the Chameleon object called `chmln` on the page and adds relevant hooks for loading the rest of Chameleon.
Add this script first and then follow it up with the call to `chmln.identify`.

```javascript
!function(d,w){var t="...
```

## Identifying users {#identify}

On each page load (and full-page refresh) you need to identify the current User + Account to Chameleon.

```javascript
chmln.identify(user.id, { company: { uid: account.id } });
```

We highly recommend using [Identity verification](https://help.chameleon.io/en/articles/4281577) where Chameleon will only accept verified requests.
On your server, you generate a `SHA256` of the User ID and the current timestamp connected with a dash inside and outside the hash (the `chameleon_uid_hash` key shown below is just an example key name).

<Note>The [full list](https://github.com/chamaeleonidae/verification) of Examples in [Node.js](https://github.com/chamaeleonidae/verification/blob/master/verification.js), [Python](https://github.com/chamaeleonidae/verification/blob/master/verification.py), [Ruby](https://github.com/chamaeleonidae/verification/blob/master/verification.rb), etc.</Note>

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

const secret = process.env.CHAMELEON_VERIFICATION_SECRET;
const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);

const uid_hash = [crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(`${uid}-${now}`).digest('hex'), now].join('-');
```

Then pass `uid_hash` in the options to `chmln.identify`

```javascript
chmln.identify(user.id, { uid_hash: user.chameleon_uid_hash, company: { uid: account.id } });
```


## Navigating your Application {#on-app-navigate}

Imagine that you want to send your Users to the billing page. With this script you can setup a Navigate type of HelpBar [SearchItem](apis/search#schema-search-items) for the Billing page and link to `/settings/billing`.
When this item is clicked you will receive a callback to `app:navigate` with opts set to `{ to: "/settings/billing" }`

#### React {#on-app-navigate-js}

```javascript
chmln.on('app:navigate', (opts) => {
  /* opts.to is the URL to navigate to. This value is set by previous calls to add SearchItems */

  window.history.pushState(null, null, opts.to);
});
```

#### React {#on-app-navigate-react}

```jsx
import { useMemo } from 'react';
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

const ChmlnHooks = () => {
  let history = useHistory();

  useMemo(() => {
    chmln.on('app:navigate', (opts) => { return history.push(opts.to); });
  }, [history]);
}

  // then in index.js
  <ChmlnHooks />
```
