## API Principles

- The API is straightforward, flexible, and designed with RESTful intentions.
- It is consistent in its application of parameters/options and paginates with cursors.
- Attributes may be added from time to time, please ignore anything you don't need.
- Use the appropriate `expand` parameters to limit data when the full dataset is not required.
