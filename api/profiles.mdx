User Profiles represent your *product's end-users*: real individuals who were identified to Chameleon. They can store complex (semi-arbitrary) properties about who they are.

The Chameleon User Profiles API allows you to:

- Create / Update custom User properties
- Retrieve a user by `id`, `uid` and `email`
- Search for users or get the count of users using any of the properties you have sent to us
- Clear or reset a specific user's data
- Delete a user permanently
