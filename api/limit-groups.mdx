Rate Limit Groups are used for Microsurveys and Tours to make sure no more than X Experiences per Y time period are shown to a user.

An example of this are your "How do you find this Feature?" Microsurveys. You may want only want to show one per week to limit fatigue.
Your Limit Group would have `rate_limit_size=1` and `rate_limit_kind=7d` then include all of the Microsurveys.

> Rate Limit Groups can purposefully overlap and work together to form a cohesive Rate Limiting strategy, to learn more or to run your strategy by the Team, feel free to [Contact us](https://app.chameleon.io/help).

At certain moments an experience can be exempt from a Rate Limit Group policy. These cases are all considered to be manually delivered:

- Explicitly [toggling them off](https://app.chameleon.io/rate-limiting) to rate-unlimit it.
- When [manually delivered](https://help.chameleon.io/en/articles/3406346-choosing-a-delivery-method) via Short Link
- via [JavaScript API](/js/show-tour)
- via [Deliveries API](/api/deliveries)
- When shown in a [Launcher](/api/launchers)

```

| param | - | description |
