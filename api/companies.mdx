Companies represent your *accounts*: real customers who were identified to Chameleon. They can store complex (semi-arbitrary) properties.

<Info>
For a full list of your User / Company Properties see the [Properties API](/api/properties)
</Info>

## Schema

**Fully-expanded Company** when listed directly or embedded with `expand` param specified properly:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | ID | The Chameleon ID |
| `created_at` | timestamp | When this happened or when this was added to the Database |
| `uid` | string | The external ID that came from your backend system |
| `*any options` | mixed | Any other options you have sent as Custom Properties will show up here too |

**Non-expanded Company** when embedded in another (i.e. Microsurvey response):

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | ID | The Chameleon ID |
| `created_at` | timestamp | When this happened or when this was added to the Database |
| `uid` | string | The external ID that came from your backend system |

## Search Companies

Searching Companies through the Chameleon API allows you to:

- Search for a company by `id` and `uid`

<Note>
[Rate Limiting](/concepts/rate-limiting) applies according to the table below.
</Note>

| endpoint | Maximum concurrent requests |
|--------------------| --------------------------- |
| `/companies` | 2 |

### Examples

All of these examples are based directly on the full schema of [Segmentation Filter Expressions](/concepts/filters).

Each example below is showing the value for the `filters` key in the JSON request body:

```json
{
  "filters": [
    // ... filter objects
  ]
}
```

**Companies that have a specific uid:**

Find the company with the `uid` of `123`:

```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "kind": "property",
      "prop": "uid",
      "op": "eq",
      "value": "123"
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
curl -H "X-Account-Secret: ACCOUNT_SECRET" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"filters":[{"kind":"property","prop":"uid","op":"eq","value":"123"}]}' \
     https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/analyze/companies
```

## Delete a Company

When deleting a company, the company record itself is deleted and company is removed from all profiles associated with it.
The associated profiles can also be removed by passing `cascade=profiles` with the request.

| param | - | description |
| ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id` | optional | The Chameleon ID of the Company |
| `uid` | optional | The Company identifier (typically the Database ID from your backend) |

### HTTP Request

Either `id` or `uid` is required.

```http
DELETE https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/edit/companies/:id
# OR
DELETE https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/edit/company?uid=:uid
```

### HTTP Response

The endpoint returns `id` of the Deletion record. The Deletion is an internal Chameleon record that can be referenced as proof of initiating this request.

```json
{
  "deletion": {
    "id": "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d5"
  }
}
```

### Deleting a company and all profiles associated with it

Deleting a company and all profiles associated with it can be done by passing `cascade=profiles`:

```http
DELETE https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/edit/companies/:id?cascade=profiles
# OR
DELETE https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/edit/company?uid=:uid&cascade=profiles
```

### HTTP Response

When cascade deletion is requested, the endpoint also returns deletion ids of all the profiles associated with the company under `deletions` key.

```json
{
  "deletion": {
    "id": "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d5"
  },
  "deletions": [
    { "id": "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d6" },
    { "id": "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d7" },
    { "id": "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d8" }
