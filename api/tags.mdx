A Tag is a grouping of Experiences based on a readable name (i.e. `"Upsell"`, `"Feature"` etc.)

Tags are:

- Used to Search and Filter Experiences in the [Chameleon Dashboard](https://app.chameleon.io).
- Used to define [Rate Limit Groups](apis/limit-groups.md) of Experiences that are limited to a particular rate limit (i.e. 2 per week, 3 per month etc.).
- [Normalized](/concepts/normalization#tags) with the typical rules.
