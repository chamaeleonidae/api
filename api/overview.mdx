Access and manage your Chameleon data programmatically with our RESTful HTTP API. Perfect for server-side integrations, data exports, and automation workflows.

<Warning>
All API requests require authentication with your Account Secret. Find yours in your [Chameleon dashboard](https://app.chameleon.io) under Settings > Integrations.
</Warning>

## Quick Example

```bash
curl -H "X-Account-Secret: YOUR_ACCOUNT_SECRET" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     https://api.chameleon.io/v3/analyze/profiles
```

## API Design Principles

- **RESTful**: Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **JSON**: All requests and responses use JSON format
- **Consistent**: Uniform parameter patterns across endpoints
- **Paginated**: Large datasets use cursor-based pagination
- **Expandable**: Use `expand` parameters to control response size

## Available Endpoints

Currently, our REST API supports the following endpoints:

| Model + details | List URL | Show URL |
|---|---|---|
| [User Profiles](/api/profiles) | `GET /v3/analyze/profiles` | `GET v3/analyze/profiles/:id` |
| [Companies](/api/companies) | `GET /v3/analyze/companies` | `GET v3/analyze/companies/:id` |
| [Segments](/api/segments) | `GET /v3/edit/segments` | `GET /v3/edit/segments/:id` |
| [Tours](/api/tours) | `GET /v3/edit/tours` | `GET /v3/edit/tours/:id` |
| [Microsurveys](/api/surveys) | `GET /v3/edit/surveys` | `GET /v3/edit/surveys/:id` |
| [Experience Deliveries](/api/deliveries) | `GET /v3/edit/deliveries` | `GET /v3/edit/delivery/:id` |
| [Webhooks](/api/webhooks) | `GET /v3/edit/webhooks` | `GET v3/edit/webhooks/:id` |

## Ideas for how you can use this API

Chameleon's REST API is made to be adaptable to your own custom use cases. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you might want to use it:

- **Import data** (via CSV) on a one-time or recurring basis
- Register a **Webhook** to receive realtime notifications of **Microsurvey Responses**
- Use the **Microsurveys Endpoint** to download **Microsurvey Response** data periodically
- Get a list of all the User data being sent to Chameleon and manipulate it (delete, update, etc.) through the **User Profiles Endpoint**
- Trigger an Experience via REST API that will run on next page load via **Experience Deliveries**
