**This documentation offers a preview of Chameleon's upcoming API. Until general release is announced, users should beware that features may not work as intended! 🐛**

## Welcome to the Chameleon Developer Hub! 

You can use this documentation alongside our [Product Documentation](https://help.trychameleon.com/) to do more with Chameleon. 

**Our Chameleon API is subdivided essentially in three main portions:** a client-side [JavaScript API](/js/overview.md), a REST API and Webhooks. With these, you can achieve more with our product and create custom integrations to fit your use cases.

You can interact with our API to:
- **Send data to Chameleon**: This can include letting Chameleon know when a user completes an action, or when their profile changes (e.g. they become paid.) You can remove/delete user data, opt a user out of Chameleon Experiences, and send variables for users to use within the copy of any Experience (e.g. user first names). 
- **Get data from Chameleon**: You can download data from Chameleon (e.g. responses to Microsurveys) periodically or forward Chameleon-tracked events (e.g. Tour completed) in real-time to your database, data warehouse, or other tools. You can also do things like download list of all users, segments, Experiences etc. or get all the stats on a particular Experience. 
- **Manage Experiences**: You can use the Chameleon API to show a Tour or Launcher, or approve many domains within your product to show Chameleon Experiences. 

The API is straightforward, flexible, and designed with RESTful intentions. It is consistent in its application of parameters/options and paginates with cursors.
