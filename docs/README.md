# Chameleon API Docs

Welcome to the Chameleon API. You can use this documentation alongside our [Product documentation](https://help.trychameleon.com) to do more with Chameleon. With the various APIs available you can Track Events, store properties on your User Profiles, see your Microsurvey Responses, assess the size of User Segments, and much more.

The API is straightforward, flexible, and designed with RESTful intentions. It is consistent in its application of parameters/options and paginates with cursors.

**This documentation offers a preview of Chameleon's upcoming API. Until general release is announced, users should beware that every feature may not work! üêõ**

 If you have any questions/comments/feature requests they can be [submitted here](https://app.trychameleon.com/help/request).
