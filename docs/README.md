# Chameleon API Docs

Welcome to the Chameleon API. You can use this documentation alongside our [Product documentation](https://help.trychameleon.com) to do more with Chameleon. With the various APIs available you can Track Events, store properties on your User Profiles, see your Survey Responses, assess the size of User Segments and much more.

The API is straight forward, flexible and designed with RESTful intentions. It is consistent in its application of parameters/options and paginates with cursors.

 If you have any questions/comments/feature requests they can be [submitted here](https://app.trychameleon.com/help/request).
