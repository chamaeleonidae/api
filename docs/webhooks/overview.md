# Overview

**These webhook-style REST endpoints are a simple way to get data into Chameleon**.

Currently, our Incoming Webhooks API supports the following two advanced use cases:

 - To send data from your Backend into Chameleon for targeting with [Segments](apis/segments.md).
 - To send data directly from our Integration partners. Two examples are [Heap](https://heap.io?utm_source=Chameleon) and [Customer.io](https://customer.io?utm_source=Chameleon) which both have the robust omni-webhook functionality to send Data directly into Chameleon.
