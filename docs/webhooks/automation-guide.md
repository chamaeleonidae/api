- Use user segment filters to focus on relevant users

### **Missing Data in Payload**
- Check which webhook topic provides the data you need
- Some fields may be null for certain user types or scenarios
- Use conditional logic to handle missing fields gracefully

### **Automation Timing Out**
- Simplify complex logic or break into multiple steps
- Add error handling for external API calls
- Consider using data storage for multi-step workflows
