# Overview


The Javascript API is the client-side portion of Chameleon's API. With it, you can access and manipulate a wide variety of data that exists on the client.



## Ideas for how you can use this API

- Send data about whether a user has completed a specific tour to your marketing automation tool, so you can send emails accordingly.
- Update user records in Chameleon when users take key actions in your product, in order to target them with relevant tours.
- Update user records in Chameleon with data from other data sources that we don't yet integrate with, such as a Customer Support tool or NPS provider.
- Start a tour when a user completes uploading some key data to their account, to congratulate them and show them the next steps.
- Change the branding of Chameleon tours based on the brand settings for any particular custom account.
