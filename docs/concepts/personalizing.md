```

### Display a timestamp/date in a presentable format | `time_local` helper :id=examples-time-local

Internally this helper generates a `Date` object and then calls `toLocaleString`.

- The first argument is the locale of the identified user
  1. If you use [Translations](https://help.chameleon.io/en/articles/5868890) then it will be the same locale you've configured or falling back
  1. The browsers reported locale

- The second argument is any `options` that are passed to the `time_local` helper. The examples below are non-exhaustive and you can use any/all of the `options` found in the [`toLocaleString` reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString) or [options reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat#options)


> For the examples below, the user is in Pacific time

```text
{{time_local created}} # the default
# 3/4/2027, 4:02:00 AM

{{time_local created year="numeric" weekday="long" month="short" day="numeric"}} # nicer looking format
# Thursday, Mar 4, 2027

{{time_local created year="numeric" weekday="long" month="short" day="numeric" hour="numeric" minute="numeric"}} # nicer looking format with hours
# Thursday, Mar 4, 2027, 4:00 AM

{{time_local created timeZoneName="short"}} # for a user in Pacific time; show the timezone
# 3/4/2027, 4:02:00 AM PST

{{time_local created timeZone="UTC"}} # lock to UTC
# 3/4/2027, 12:02:00 PM

{{time_local created timeZone=time_z}} # for a who has a `time_z` property for Brussels (time_z without quotes since it's a user property)
# 3/4/2027, 1:02:00 PM

{{time_local created timeZone=time_z timeZoneName="short"}} # short Brussels
# 3/4/2027, 1:02:00 PM GMT+1

{{time_local created timeZone=time_z timeZoneName="long"}} # long Brussels
# 3/4/2027, 1:02:00 PM Central European Standard Time

```

The tense word can be singular **or** plural when it's passed in.

```text
You've used {{pluralize credits.used "credit"}} and have {{pluralize credits.remaining "credit"}} left.
# You've used 19 credits and have 1 credit left.

Your next bill is for ${{pluralize plan.spend "dollar"}}.
# Your next bill is for $734 dollars.

Your next bill is ${{pluralize plan.spend "dollars"}}.
# Your next bill is $734 dollars.
