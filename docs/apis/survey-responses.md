# Microsurvey Responses

**A microsurvey response is a single object with all of the information about the microsurvey interactions: the buttons clicked on the first step, the text input entered in the follow-up step, and the time that the microsurvey was finished.**

------

Using Chameleon's API for microsurvey responses, you can:

- List microsurvey responses.
- Delete a microsurvey response.
