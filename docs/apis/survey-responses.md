# Microsurvey Responses

**A microsurvey response is a single object with all of the information about the microsurvey interactions: the buttons clicked on the first step, the text input entered in the follow-up step, and the time that the microsurvey was finished.**

------

Using Chameleon's API for microsurvey responses, you can:

- List microsurvey responses.
- Delete a microsurvey response.

## List Microsurvey Responses :id=responses-index

#### HTTP Request

```
GET https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/analyze/responses
```

| param          | -        | description                                                  |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id             | required | The Chameleon ID of the Microsurvey                          |
| limit          | optional | Defaults to `50` with a maximum of `500`                     |
| before         | optional | Used when paginating, use directly from the `cursor` object from the previous response |
| before         | optional | Read as "created `before`" and can be given as a timestamp or ID to get only `limit` items that were created before this time |
| after          | optional | Read as "created `after`" and can be given as a timestamp or ID to get only `limit` items that were created after this time |
| expand         | optional | Object that specifies relationships to include/exclude. Supported keys are `profile` and `company`      |
| expand.profile | optional | use values of `all`, `min` or `skip` to control the properties present in the `profile`. Defaults to `min` |
| expand.company | optional | use values of `all`, `min` or `skip` to control the properties present in the `company`. Defaults to `min` |

#### Using the `expand` parameter

```
# As a URL parameter
expand[profile]=all&expand[company]=skip

# In the Reqeust body
{"expand":{"profile":"all","company":"skip"}}
```

Notes:
- A `profile` key will always be present with an object value. The `company` (embedded within `profile`) will be missing when the User Profile is not attached to a Company, otherwise it will be an object.
- The combination of `before` and `after` can be used to limit pagination to "stop" at your most recently cached Survey Response (send the max ID from your last import as the `after` parameter).
