## Limits

- The size of each batch request is limited to 16mb
- As with the [Single Profile update](/webhooks/profiles#profiles-update), up to a total of 768 bytes are stored for each scalar value where each Array item and each Hash value can reach this limit.
- See the full page on [Normalization](/concepts/normalization#limits) for more information on these limits.

#### Examples

<Info>
Either set the number of items per batch to _10,000_ OR to approximate the number of
items per batch (based on the average payload size), divide (16777216 / "Average characters in JSON payload per item") * 0.95
</Info>

With the following update, you can send approximately _265,000 User Profiles_ per batch request

```json
{

  "plan": "gold"
}
```
