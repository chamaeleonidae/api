## Limits

#### Examples

<Note>Either set the number of items per batch to _10,000_ OR to approximate the number of items per batch (based on the average payload size), divide (16777216 / "Average characters in JSON payload per item") * 0.95</Note>

With the following update, you can send approximately _257,000 Companies_ per batch request

```json
