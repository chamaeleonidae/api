description: "Track Events to Chameleon from services like Customer.io, Heap, Zapier or from your own backend."

Looking for the [JavaScript API](/js/events)?

------

> Events are processed asynchronously (typically within thirty seconds).
> Events and their properties can be used for Segmentation, Goals, Launcher item completed etc.
> Events tracked for users that have not yet been seen by Chameleon will be created first and then the event tracked to them

  "uid": 18821,
  "name": "Scheduled follow up",

  "scheduling_source": "upsell",
  "scheduling_link": "https://acme.claendly.com/meetings/round-robin/15-min"

}
```

## Normalized Event naming

By default, Events are grouped by their case insensitive and normalized name value. The following are all counted as the _Same Event_

- "Imported Leads" => `imported_leads`
- "ImporteD leads" => `imported_leads`
- "imported-leads" => `imported_leads`

To know more about how Events are normalized, visit the [Normalization](/concepts/normalization#events) page.
