## Data into Chameleon

These webhooks are a simple way to get data into Chameleon.

Currently, our Incoming Webhooks API supports the following two advanced use cases:

- To send data from your Backend into Chameleon for targeting with [Segments](/apis/segments).
- To send data directly from our Integration partners. Some examples are [Heap](https://heap.io?utm_source=Chameleon) and [Customer.io](https://customer.io?utm_source=Chameleon) which both have the robust omni-webhook functionality to send Data directly into Chameleon.


| Model + details | URL |
|-----------------|-----|
| [User Profiles](/webhooks/profiles) | `POST /v3/observe/hooks/:account_secret/profiles` |
| [Companies](/webhooks/companies) | `POST /v3/observe/hooks/:account_secret/companies` |
| [Events](/webhooks/events) | `POST /v3/observe/hooks/:account_secret/events` |


### Integration partners
- [Heap webhooks](https://help.chameleon.io/en/articles/1349836-heap-integration-user-guide)
- [Customer.io webhooks](https://help.chameleon.io/en/articles/1349829-customer-io-integration-user-guide)


### Limits

- Up to a total of 768 bytes are stored for each scalar value where each Array item and each Hash value can reach this limit.
- See the full page on [Limits](/concepts/normalization#limits) for more information.
- Any data received that exceeds this limit will be truncated at the 768th byte and a warning surfaced on the data management page for [user data](https://app.chameleon.io/data/properties/profile) or for [company data](https://app.chameleon.io/data/properties/company).

### Normalization

- Property names are normalized to lower case and underscored i.e. `planName` => `plan_name`.
- See the full page on [Normalization](/concepts/normalization#properties) for more information.

## Data out of Chameleon

Chameleon can send webhooks to your backend when users interact with Experiences. See the [Outgoing Webhooks](/webhooks/outgoing) page for full details on topics, schemas, verification, and payload examples.
