## Data into Chameleon

These webhooks are a simple way to get data into Chameleon.

Currently, our Incoming Webhooks API supports the following two advanced use cases:

- To send data from your Backend into Chameleon for targeting with [Segments](/apis/segments).
- To send data directly from our Integration partners. Some examples are [Heap](https://heap.io?utm_source=Chameleon) and [Customer.io](https://customer.io?utm_source=Chameleon) which both have the robust omni-webhook functionality to send Data directly into Chameleon.


| Model + details | URL |
|-----------------|-----|
| [User Profiles](/webhooks/profiles) | `POST /v3/observe/hooks/:account_secret/profiles` |
| [Companies](/webhooks/companies) | `POST /v3/observe/hooks/:account_secret/companies` |
| [Events](/webhooks/events) | `POST /v3/observe/hooks/:account_secret/events` |


### Integration partners
- [Heap webhooks](https://help.chameleon.io/en/articles/1349836-heap-integration-user-guide)
- [Customer.io webhooks](https://help.chameleon.io/en/articles/1349829-customer-io-integration-user-guide)


### Limits

- Up to a total of 768 bytes are stored for each scalar value where each Array item and each Hash value can reach this limit.
- See the full page on [Limits](/concepts/normalization#limits) for more information.
- Any data received that exceeds this limit will be truncated at the 768th byte and a warning surfaced on the data management page for [user data](https://app.chameleon.io/data/properties/profile) or for [company data](https://app.chameleon.io/data/properties/company).

### Normalization

- Property names are normalized to lower case and underscored i.e. `planName` => `plan_name`.
- See the full page on [Normalization](/concepts/normalization#properties) for more information.

## Data out of Chameleon
A webhook is an agreed-upon method of data exchange across a **secure channel**. Since you will be adding a new endpoint to your backend servers to handle this webhook, is it **strongly recommended** that you [verify the signature](/webhooks/overview#verification) of any webhook requests before processing any included data.

When sending a webhook to your backend Chameleon will:
 - Send a `POST` request to your `https` [configured endpoints](https://app.chameleon.io/integrations/webhooks).
 - Attempt delivery right away from `aws us-east`, use a request timeout of 7 seconds and include a `User-Agent` header specific to the [API version](/concepts/authentication#version) the webhook is being sent from.
 - Generate a SHA256-HMAC signature of the request body and include the signature in the `X-Chameleon-Signature` header
 - In case of non-200 status code, will retry a total of 9 times over 43 hours (giving you a chance to fix errors without losing track of these webhooks)

When receiving a webhook from Chameleon you should:
 - Only accept requests from [Chameleon IP Addresses](/concepts/authentication#ip-addresses)
 - [Verify](/webhooks/overview#verification) the Webhook request signature; respond with a status `400` if the signature does not match
 - Drop the request if the webhook is too old (to prevent replay attacks); respond with a status `400`
 - Respond quickly with a `200` status code (or any `2xx` status code)
 - Optional: Request any related data with the [other APIs](/apis/overview)

<a id="schema"></a>
#### Schema (request body)
| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | ID | The Chameleon ID |
| `sent_at` | timestamp | The current server time when this webhook was sent (used in [verification](/webhooks/overview#verification)) |
| `kind` | enum | The [topic identifier](/webhooks/overview#topics) |
| `data` | object | Contains the webhook payload data. This can be any models included by singular or plural name |

<a id="headers"></a>
#### Request headers
| Header | Example value | Description |
| --- | --- |--- |
| `X-Chameleon-Id` | `5f3c4232c712de665632a2a3` | The Chameleon ID of this webhook |
| `X-Chameleon-Signature` | 5a17b.... | The SHA256-HMAC of the raw request body |
| `User-Agent` | `Chameleon Webhooks/v3 (chameleon.io; integral)` | The request is from the Chameleon v3 API (integral environment)|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Signifying that the request body is JSON |
| `Accept` | `application/json` | Signifying that the response should be JSON (or nothing) |


<a id="verification"></a>
### Verifying the Webhook
The signature is the SHA256-HMAC of your [Webhook Secret](https://app.chameleon.io/integrations/webhooks) and the request body.
As a second step, reject the message if it was sent outside of a few minutes (in the examples below 5 minutes is used; to prevent replay attacks)

### Verification Examples

<a id="rails"></a>
###### Rails
 ```ruby
# Assumes this code runs in a Controller to access the `request` object
# Could easily be run in a background task or elsewhere by passing the `X-Chameleon-Signature` and `request.raw_post` exactly as-is

secret = ENV['CHAMELEON_VERIFICATION_SECRET']
received = request.headers['X-Chameleon-Signature']
expected = OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest('SHA256', secret, request.raw_post)

verified = ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(received, expected) &&
  (sent_at = Time.zone.parse(params[:sent_at])) &&
  (sent_at > 5.minutes.ago && sent_at < 5.minutes.from_now)
```

<a id="example-helpbar-answer"></a>
##### Example helpbar-answer
This is the most important HelpBar webhook; it can directly inform your roadmap for additional updated/documentation.

- Chameleon AI Answering operates best when:
 - A headline (h2/h3) in the Help center article is relevant to the question being asked
 - Multiple inputs corroborate from different angles
- Seeing a `results_count` less than 3 is an important metric to track
- Use `references` to know where to make improvements

<a id="example-survey-all"></a>
##### Example survey-all
These three topics are considered lifecycle events and occur when the user is presented with or interacts with a Chameleon
Microsurvey. The `response.finished` Webhook is only sent when we consider the user **done** with the Microsurvey and will
no longer interact with it. A [Microsurvey Response](/apis/survey-responses) is generated when the Microsurvey Step + associated
Response Step are finished; it sends a `response.finished` Webhook.

A Microsurvey is started on the _Survey_ Step and either `completed` or `exited` when the first step is "actioned". It then automatically
branches through a sequence of optional _Response_ Steps and finishes with an optional _Thank You_ Step.

> The Steps corresponding to a _Response_ Step have `preset=response`; The _Thank You_ Steps have  `preset=thank_you`

<a id="example-demo-finished"></a>
##### Example demo-finished
This webhook topic only differs from `demo.started` by the addition of the following keys in the `demo_run`.

1. In the `demo_run`, an `actions` array of [DemoAction](/apis/demos#schema-demo-run)s
2. In the `demo_run`, a `submissions` array of [DemoSubmission](/apis/demos#schema-demo-submission)s with a `data` key of [DemoSubmissionData](/apis/demos#schema-demo-submission-data)
3. `finished_kind` in the `demo_run` as either `"last_step"` or `"timeout_30m"` to give an indication of how this Demo was finished

It will be sent when the last step of the Demo is reached with `finished_kind=last_step` _OR_ approximately
30 minutes after the last activity in the Demo and `finished_kind=timeout_30m`.

<a id="example-demo-email-added"></a>
##### Example demo-email-added
This webhook topic is meant to capture the moment when previously taken anonymous Demos receive an email address.
The flow can be arbitrarily complex but typically follows one of these paths:

1. **Demos taken => Submits interest form**
   1. User takes 1 or more Demos on the marketing site, help documentation, etc.
   2. In one of the Demos, the User submits a form with their email
   3. Chameleon will then update all the previous [DemoRun](/apis/demos#schema-demo-run)s from [1i] (e.g. those connected with the `anonymous_id`)
   4. Chameleon sends one `demo.email.added` webhook per updated [DemoRun](/apis/demos#schema-demo-run)

2. **Demos taken => Product signup**
   1. User takes 1 or more Demos on the marketing site, help documentation, etc.
   2. User sign up for the product and is [identified](/js/overview#examples) with their email address
   3. Chameleon will then update all the previous [DemoRun](/apis/demos#schema-demo-run)s from [2i] (e.g. those connected with the `anonymous_id`)
   4. Chameleon sends one `demo.email.added` webhook per updated [DemoRun](/apis/demos#schema-demo-run)

`action.email` will have email address as a copy of the email address now found in `demo_run.email`.
