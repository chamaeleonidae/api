## What you can do

**Our Chameleon API is subdivided in three main portions:** a client-side [JavaScript API](/js/overview), a [REST API](/apis/overview) and [Webhooks](/webhooks/overview). With these, you can achieve more with our product and create custom integrations to fit your use cases.

- **Send data to Chameleon**: Let Chameleon know when a user completes an action, when their profile changes (e.g. they become paid), remove/delete user data, opt a user out of Experiences, and send variables for personalizing Experience content (e.g. user first names).
- **Get data from Chameleon**: Download data (e.g. Microsurvey responses) periodically or forward Chameleon-tracked events (e.g. Tour completed) in real-time to your database, data warehouse, or other tools. Download lists of users, segments, Experiences, or get stats on a particular Experience.
- **Manage Experiences**: Show a Tour or Launcher, trigger Deliveries to specific users, manage Environments, publish/unpublish Experiences, and configure HelpBar search content.

#### By design:

- The API is straightforward, flexible, and designed with RESTful intentions.
- It is consistent in its application of parameters/options and paginates with cursors.
- Attributes may be added from time to time, please ignore anything you don't need.
- Use the appropriate `expand` parameters to limit data when the full dataset is not required.
