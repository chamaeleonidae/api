title: "Embeddables"
description: "Embeddables are persistent, in-app widgets that can be embedded directly into your product's UI. Unlike Tours that appear as overlays, Embeddables are rendered inline within your application."
---

------

An Embeddable is displayed when:

- **URL matching** - the page must match the configured URL conditions.
- **Segmentation matches** - User is the right person (required but can be set to match All Users).
- **Element targeting** - Embeddables are rendered relative to a specific element on the page.

*To know more about Embeddables, visit our [product documentation](https://help.chameleon.io/en/collections/7829085-embeddables).*

------

With the Chameleon API for Embeddables, you can:

- List all the Embeddables that follow a specified set of parameters.
- Retrieve a single Embeddable based on the `id`.
- Update an Embeddable to change Environments or publish/unpublish it.
