title: "Event Names"
description: "Event Names represent the tracked and custom events in your Chameleon account. Use the Event Names API to list and retrieve your configured events."
---

Event Names represent the events that Chameleon tracks for your account. These include events sent via the [JavaScript API](/js/events) (e.g. `chmln.track('Signed up')`) and events forwarded from integrations like Segment. Events can be used in [Segmentation Filters](/concepts/filters) to target users who have (or haven't) performed specific actions.

------

With the Chameleon API for Event Names, you can:

- Retrieve a list of all Event Names in your account.
- Retrieve a single Event Name by its `id`.
- See which events are published (actively tracked) vs. unpublished.
