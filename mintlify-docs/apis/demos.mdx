## Using Demos with your CRM
Chameleon can create new (and update existing) **Contact** and **Company** records in response to interactions with Demos.
Completions of, and Tags of Demos will be stored as properties; the data schema is [below](#schema-crm).


### Contacts

These are the moments when Chameleon will sync **Contact** data to your CRM:

1. When an anonymous user submits a form with their email address
2. When an [identified user](/js/demos#mode-profile) with an email address starts a Demo

What will happen in the above situations?

1. A **Contact** is created or updated
2. `Chameleon Demos last seen time` is updated
3. The current Demo is added to `Chameleon Demos Seen` and the Tags (if any) are added to `Chameleon Demos Tags`
4. Any previous demos attached to the same `anonymous_id` will be added to the respective properties from [3]


### Companies

These are the moments when Chameleon will sync **Company** data to your CRM:

1. When [Clearbit reveal](https://app.chameleon.io/integrations/clearbit) is enabled, the Demo user has `consent_mode=granted` and a match is found

What will happen in the above situation?

1. A **Company** is created or updated
