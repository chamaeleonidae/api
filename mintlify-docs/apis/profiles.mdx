description: >
  User Profiles represent your product's end-users: real individuals who were identified to Chameleon. They can store complex (semi-arbitrary) properties about who they are.

> For a full list of your User / Company Properties see the [Properties API](/apis/properties)

The Chameleon User Profiles API allows you to:

- Create / Update custom User properties
- Retrieve a user by `id`, `uid` and `email`.
- Search for users or get the count of users using any of the properties you have sent to us.
- Clear or reset a specific user's data.
- Delete a user permanently

## Retrieve a specific User
#### HTTP Request

```
GET|POST https://api.chameleon.io/v3/analyze/profiles/:id
GET|POST https://api.chameleon.io/v3/analyze/profile # singular with parameters
```

| param | -        | description                                                  |

Only one of these parameters is required. Users matched are uniquely identified based on these keys (no two users have the same `uid` or `email`)

```
?id=5f3c4232c712de665632a6d5
?uid=18821
?email=leon@chmln.co
```

When using a **POST** request send one of these properties:

```json
{
  "id": "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d5",
  "uid": 18821,
  "email": "leon@chmln.co"

## Clear or Reset a User Profile
Clearing a profile consists of:

- Resetting the properties such as browser width, last seen time, sessions count, etc..
- Removing Microsurvey responses.
- Reverts summary data from any actions this user took (i.e. Tour Started counts decremented appropriately).
- Removes and resets any Events that were tracked for this user.
- A new `percent` is assigned and `last_cleared_at` is updated to `"$now"`.
- A few other internal cleanup items.

It is also possible to clear a user profile through the [Chameleon Dashboard](https://app.chameleon.io/testing) but is limited to profiles associated with the currently logged-in Chameleon Admin. To clear any profile on your account use this API.

<a id="delete-a-user-profile-permanently"></a>
## Delete a User Profile permanently
The ability to delete a User Permanently is part of our effort to allow your users to opt-out of continued data storage by Chameleon and its partners.
The key actions taken directly after deleting a User, is to remove Associated data before then removing the User profile data.
Associated data includes records of Chameleon Experiences, Events logged and any other internal metrics associated with actions the user has taken.
At the end of the process no record of this user exists in our database. Additionally, any data stored in backups relating to user profile data in our database has a retention of 3 months.

#### HTTP Request

DELETE https://api.chameleon.io/v3/edit/profiles/:id/forget
# OR
DELETE https://api.chameleon.io/v3/edit/profiles/forget?uid=:uid

| id    | optional | A Chameleon User Profile ID to remove                                  |
| uid   | optional | The User Profile Identifier (typically the Database ID from your backend) |
| `email` | optional | If you have sent an email address, this will be available for single-user lookup |
