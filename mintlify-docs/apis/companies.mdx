<a id="companies-search"></a>
### Search Companies
Searching Companies through the Chameleon API allows you to:

- Search for a company by `id` and `uid`

> *Note: [Rate Limiting](/concepts/rate-limiting) applies according to the table below.*

| endpoint           | Maximum concurrent requests |
|--------------------| --------------------------- |
| `/companies`       | 2                           |


<a id="companies-search-examples"></a>
#### Examples
All of these examples are based directly on the full schema of [Segmentation Filter Expressions](/concepts/filters).

Each example below is showing the value for the `filters` key in the JSON request body:

```json
{
  "filters": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

##### Companies that have a specific uid

Find the company with the `uid` of `123`:

```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "kind": "property",
      "prop": "uid",
      "op": "eq",
      "value": "123"
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
curl -H "X-Account-Secret: ACCOUNT_SECRET" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST \
     -d '{"filters":[{"kind":"property","prop":"uid","op":"eq","value":"123"}]}' \
     https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/analyze/companies
```

<a id="companies-delete"></a>
## Delete a Company
When deleting a company, the company record itself is deleted and company is removed from all profiles associated with it. 
The associated profiles can also be removed by passing `cascade=profiles` with the request.

| param.  | -        | description                                                          |
| ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`    | optional | The Chameleon ID of the [Company](/apis/companies)                 |
| `uid`   | optional | The Company identifier (typically the Database ID from your backend) |


#### HTTP Request

Either `id` or `uid` is required.

```
DELETE https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/edit/companies/:id
# OR
DELETE https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/edit/company?uid=:uid
```

#### HTTP Response

The endpoint returns `id` of the Deletion record.
The Deletion is an internal Chameleon record that can be referenced as proof of initiating this request.
   
```json
{
  "deletion": {
    "id": "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d5"
  }
}
```

### Deleting a company and all profiles associated with it
Deleting a company and all profiles associated with it can be done by passing `cascade=profiles`:

```
DELETE https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/edit/companies/:id?cascade=profiles
# OR
DELETE https://api.trychameleon.com/v3/edit/company?uid=:uid&cascade=profiles
```

#### HTTP Response

When cascade deletion is requested, the endpoint also returns deletion ids of all the profiles associated with the company under `deletions` key. 

```json
{
  "deletion": {
    "id": "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d5"
  },
  "deletions": [
    { "id":  "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d6" },
    { "id":  "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d7" },
    { "id":  "5f3c4232c712de665632a6d8" }
  ]
}
```
