  Segments are fundamental to targeting users within Chameleon. They are used for Microsurveys, Tours and Launchers to make sure the right users see the right content at the right moment.

With the Chameleon API for Segments, you can:

- Retrieve a list of segments according to the specified parameters.
- Retrieve a single segment based on the `id`.
- List all the Chameleon Experiences (Tours, Microsurveys, Launchers) that are connected to a defined segment.
